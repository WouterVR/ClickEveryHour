# Click Every Hour

This is a side project of Wouter Van Rompaey. I'm trying to make a simple web application game.
You earn points by clicking the screen in the first minute of every hour. High score will be recorded, bonuses wil be rewarded for combo's, etc.
It's gonna be fun, I promise. I just hope that I don't give up before it's publishable.
## How to set up? -- note to self
Run the server locally by cd-ing into the project folder and then into src>server and executing this command:

    node index.js
