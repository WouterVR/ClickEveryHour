# Click Every Hour

This is a side project of Wouter Van Rompaey. I'm trying to make a simple web application game.
You earn points by clicking the screen in the first minute of every hour. High score will be recorded, bonuses wil be rewarded for combo's, etc.
It's gonna be fun, I promise. I just hope that I don't give up before it's publishable.

## Running the server locally
To run the server locally, cd into the project folder and then into src>server and execute this command:

    node index.js

Next, the web application is available at this address:

    http://localhost:3000

## Notes for myself
use this next time: https://github.com/petruisfan/node-supervisor
